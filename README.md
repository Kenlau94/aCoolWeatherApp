# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Tasks

Third-party APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. My challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS. The challenges for me where actually figuring out bootstrap, jquery and creating the javascript to actually utilize the api. In the future I would like to tackle this project again and utilize bootstrap and jquery. I am thankful for my fellow students, youtube and W3.
